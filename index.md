## About

I am an R&D Engineer in the Department of Scientific Computing at the **National Institute of Clean-and-Low-Carbon Energy (NICE)** focusing on **AI for Science**. Before joining NICE, I was an assistant professor in the **Department of Computer Sciences and Artificial Intelligence (School of Information Engineering)** at the **China University of Geosciences (Beijing)**.

I have hybrid backgrounds in geoscience and computer science. My primary research interests lie in utilizing data-driven methods to explore and address Earth-related problems, particularly those in paleoclimate and paleogeography. I have also been involved in projects related to geoscientific software development, quantitative stratigraphy, and spatiotemporal analytics. In addition, I was a participant of the [Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE)](https://www.ddeworld.org/) project and co-founder of the [GISphere](https://gisphere.info/) educational platform.

I finished my Ph.D. at **University of Wisconsin-Madison** where I worked on [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/) projects and was co-advised by [Shaun Marcott](https://geoscience.wisc.edu/people/marcott-shaun/) and [Shanan Peters](http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/). I hold a master's degree from the **University of Tulsa** supervised by [Bryan Tapp](https://faculty.utulsa.edu/faculty/bryan-tapp/) with a focus in computational geomechanics.
