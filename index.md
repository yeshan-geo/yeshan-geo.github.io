## About

I am an assistant professor of computer science in the **School of Information Engineering** at the **China University of Geosciences (Beijing)**.

I have hybrid backgrounds in geoscience and computer science. My primary research interests lie in utilizing data science and machine learning methods to explore and address Earth-related problems, particularly those in paleoclimate and paleogeography. I am also involved in projects related to geoscientific software development, quantitative stratigraphy, and spatiotemporal analytics. In addition, I am a participant of the [Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE)](https://www.ddeworld.org/) project and co-founder of the [GISphere](https://gisphere.info/) educational platform.

I finished my Ph.D. at University of Wisconsin-Madison where I worked on EarthCube projects and was co-advised by [Shaun Marcott](https://geoscience.wisc.edu/people/marcott-shaun/) and [Shanan Peters](http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/). I hold a master's degree from the University of Tulsa supervised by [Bryan Tapp](https://faculty.utulsa.edu/faculty/bryan-tapp/) with a focus in numeric-based geomechanics.
