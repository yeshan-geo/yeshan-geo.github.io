## About

I am an R&D Engineer in the Department of Scientific Intelligence and Computing at the **National Institute of Clean-and-Low-Carbon Energy (NICE)** focusing on **AI for Science**. Before joining NICE, I was an assistant professor in the **Department of Computer Sciences and Artificial Intelligence (School of Information Engineering)** at the **China University of Geosciences (Beijing)**.

I have hybrid backgrounds in geoscience and computer science. My primary research interests lie in utilizing data-driven methods to explore and address Earth-related problems, particularly those in paleoclimate and paleogeography. I have also been involved in projects related to geoscientific software development, quantitative stratigraphy, and spatiotemporal analytics. In addition, I was a participant of the [Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE)](https://www.ddeworld.org/) project and co-founder of the [GISphere Corporation](https://gisphere.info/).

I finished my Ph.D. at **University of Wisconsin-Madison** where I worked on [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/) projects and was co-advised by [Shaun Marcott](https://geoscience.wisc.edu/people/marcott-shaun/) and [Shanan Peters](http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/). I hold a master's degree from the **University of Tulsa** supervised by [Bryan Tapp](https://faculty.utulsa.edu/faculty/bryan-tapp/) with a focus in computational geomechanics.


## Education

- Ph.D. **University of Wisconsin-Madison**, *Geosciences (Geoinformatics)*, 2018-22
- M.S. **University of Tulsa**, *Geosciences (Computational Geomechanics)*, 2016-18
- B.S. **University of Michigan**, *Earth and Environmental Sciences*, 2013-15 & **The Pennsylvania State University**, *Geographic Information Sciences*, 2011-13

## Teaching and Mentoring

I developed (from scratch) and taught the following **new courses** at China University of Geosciences (Beijing) from 2023 to 2024:

- SR043268: [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://yeshan-geo.github.io/pages/intro_ai) (100-level)
- DR040017: [Data Analysis and Visualization](https://yeshan-geo.github.io/pages/datavis) (300-level)
- DR043229: [Computer Vision](https://yeshan-geo.github.io/pages/computer_vision) (300-level)

At China University of Geosciences (Beijing), I supervised about 15 students majoring in software engineering, computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence in completing their theses. The topics spanned a wide range, including but not limited to:
- data-driven paleoclimate research
- deep learning for geoscientific data quality assessment
- development of interactive instructional tools for structural geology classes
- the modifiable areal unit problem in geological data analysis
- assessment of extreme weather and driving safety
- multimodal generative models for urban studies
- the application of artificial intelligence in music composition.

Before that, I held temporary lecturer or teaching assistant roles for the following courses:

- GEOL 4083: GIS for Geologists (University of Tulsa, as temporary lecturer)
- UC 270: Social Justice (University of Michigan, as teaching assistant)
- GEOG 363: GIScience (The Pennsylvania State University, as teaching assistant)
