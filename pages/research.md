#### Projects

Currently, I am actively involved in the [Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE)](https://deep-time.org/), an IUGS-recognized international big science program. My work with DDE includes developing the digital basin agent product empowered by the [GeoGPT](https://geogpt.deep-time.org), and exploring a more efficient way of multi-modal geological entity classification for large language models. In addition, I conduct research on quality evaluations, modifiable areal unit problems, and sampling bias issues in paleoclimate, paleoenvironmental and paleontological data. I also supervise students on small-scale research projects in computer vision, data extraction, software engineering, and user interface/experience design.
